# cf-tools ‚Äî Cloudflare Batch Utilities

A growing collection of **small, sharp tools** for Cloudflare housekeeping tasks that are awkward or impossible to do quickly in the UI ‚Äî especially **batch** or **looped** maintenance jobs.

> **Status:** v0 ‚Äî first utility included. More coming soon.

---

## ‚ú® Included Tools

### 1) Pages Deployment Wiper (keep newest production)
Deletes **all** Cloudflare Pages deployments (both **production** and **preview**) **except** the newest production deployment for a project. Useful after a burst of commits that left hundreds of old deployments lying around.

- Loops in batches (default: 24 per sweep)
- Retries politely with backoff on 429/5xx
- Stops automatically when nothing eligible remains
- Streams clear logs for CI

**Script:** `cleanup_pages_deployments.py`

<details>
<summary>What it does, exactly</summary>

- Fetches deployments for the project (`production` and `preview`) via the Cloudflare API.
- Determines the **single newest production** deployment and marks it as the **keep**.
- Repeatedly deletes:
  - All **preview** deployments.
  - All **older production** deployments (i.e., every production deployment except the newest one).
- Works in sweeps of 24 by default until there‚Äôs nothing left to delete.
</details>

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- **Python** ‚â• 3.8
- **requests** library (`pip install -r requirements.txt` or `pip install requests`)
- A Cloudflare API token with **Pages read + delete** permissions for the account

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Irreversible:** Deletions can‚Äôt be undone. Double-check your project and account IDs.
